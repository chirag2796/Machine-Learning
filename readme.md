## About the Project

*   Various ML/DL/Mathematical implementations which I have dine over the years 

*   Includes cnventional as well as novel implementations of image GANs, online classifiers, probabilistic graphical models, NLP deep learning techniques etc.

*   A significannt amount of work covering the breadth and depth of tensorflow, keras, and scikit-learn libraries is done.


## Directories (might not be updated)
```bash
NLP: All Natural Language Processing scipts, research (experimental), and mini projects. Mostly done using nltk, rege, logic. 

Tensorflow: Most of the deep neural network projects and experiments including GANs, CNNs, RNNs, Callbacks, BERT, and others.

Scikit-Learn: Non neural network, conventional machine learning algorithms. Implementations include online courses and books.
